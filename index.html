		<h3>Describe the meeting circumstance</h3>
		<p>My friend introduced me to Sebastian. As we were sitting in a cafe waiting for him, the meeting was preplanned in a way so I wanted to try an experiment. I brainstormed different introductory first liners because often times we introduce ourselves with a hello, my name is, how are you and etc other common phrases. When Sebastian arrived, I was inspired by his jacket and introduced myself as "Hi, I'm Teodora. Nice jacket, can I have it?” He nervously laughed and said “Erm thanks, you can try it on I guess.” He proceeded to sit down, take off his jacket, place it on a chair and change the topic.</p>
		<h3>What I learned</h3>
		<p>First liners are important. After explaining to him my project, Sebastian admitted thinking that I was bizarre at first. Then he warmed up and was very nice, as noted in the photo when he even let me borrow the jacket for the photo.</p>
